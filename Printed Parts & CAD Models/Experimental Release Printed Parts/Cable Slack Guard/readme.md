# Cable Chain Experiment
We understand that some users have had issues with the Cables and Bowden getting caught on the X Rail during prints. 

This can be printed in anything, and has been tested without issue with PLA.

This uses the heatset insert that the original Bowden Guide, and the original screw to attach it.

# Printing
Default Strength Profiles work well for this, must use a 0.4 nozzle and be able to print walls that are 0.5mm thin.

# Assembly

Insert the heatset insert to the Toolhead Holder, and screw that into the Toolhead.

Slide the Links onto Bowden Tube, and place the XT30 cable into the clip side.

Lock the clips in, and push in the Band. This will secure the clips and will ensure they don't open.
