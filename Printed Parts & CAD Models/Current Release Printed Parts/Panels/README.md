## Colors
You will see three options;
1. Primary
    - This is a base color, and will be the majoriy of your build
2. Accent
    - This is a secondary, often complimentary color, and will help your build pop.
3. Any
    - These parts are not visible once the build is complete, so any color will work.

Of course, these are just color coordination suggestions, please experiment and have fun!
