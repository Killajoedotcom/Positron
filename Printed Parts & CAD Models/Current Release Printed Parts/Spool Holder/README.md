# IMPORTANT FOR THIS FOLDER
These parts can be printed in any material, as it is just to hold the Filament Spool. We do recommend you print them in all of the same material type to avoid differences in shrinkage preventing easy assembly.

# FILE NAME KEY:
`Part Name - Quantity - Recommended Color - Notes`

### Example 1;
`Bed_Cable_Guide - 1x - Accent`  

This is the `Bed_Cable_Guide`, you need to print One of them, recommended in an accent color.

### Example 2;
`Z_PCB_Spacer - 1x - Any - Non-Conductive`

This is the `Z_PCB_Spacer`, you need to print One of them, you can use any color (as it's not a visible part), and must not be conductive.

## Colors
You will see three options;
1. Primary
    - This is a base color, and will be the majoriy of your build
2. Accent
    - This is a secondary, often complimentary color, and will help your build pop.
3. Any
    - These parts are not visible once the build is complete, so any color will work.

Of course, these are just color coordination suggestions, please experiment and have fun!
