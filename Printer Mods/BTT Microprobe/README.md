# Positron v3.2 - BTT Microprobe Mod
This mod allows for a Microprobe to be mounted to the Toolhead. You will need supports as the mount is not optimized for printing.

For Wiring reference, please see [LDO's Positron Hardware Repo](https://github.com/MotorDynamicsLab/PositronHardware/tree/master/PositronV3.2).

The BTT Microprobe is mounted to the modified Fan Shroud here using Three M2x8 screws. An additional Two M2x8 screws are used to attach the BTT Microprobe to the Mount.

The Servo cable is plugged into the SERVOS pins on the MCU - GPIO29

The Probe cable is plugged into the TH0 pins on the MCU - GPIO27
> Note - TH0 / GPIO27 is unused in stock configuration.

# Recommended Print Settings

 - We recommend printing all parts in ABS or ASA
 - [We're copying Voron's homework;](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings)
    - Layer height: 0.2mm
    - Extrusion width: 0.4mm
    - Infill percentage: 40%
    - Infill type: grid, gyroid, honeycomb, triangle, or cubic
    - Wall count: 4
    - Solid top/bottom layers: 5
    - Supports: You should be able to get away with none, but you may need a few as there are a few major overhangs.

ABS or ASA is the recommended filament for most parts, PLA and PETG can be used for many accent pieces, but please only do so at your own discretion.
