# Positron v3.2 - BTT Microprobe Mod
This mod allows for a Microprobe to be mounted to the Toolhead.

As of right now, you either have to solder the Microprobe to the toolboard, or wire it directly to the MCU.

This mod is work in progress, and this will be updated as time goes on. At time of writing, this mod is untested, my parts are still printing for it.

# Recommended Print Settings

 - We recommend printing all parts in ABS or ASA
 - [We're copying Voron's homework;](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings)
    - Layer height: 0.2mm
    - Extrusion width: 0.4mm
    - Infill percentage: 40%
    - Infill type: grid, gyroid, honeycomb, triangle, or cubic
    - Wall count: 4
    - Solid top/bottom layers: 5
    - Supports: You should be able to get away with none, but you may need a few as there are a few major overhangs.

ABS or ASA is the recommended filament for most parts, PLA and PETG can be used for many accent pieces, but please only do so at your own discretion.
