# Welcome to the Probes Mod Folder
No, this is not for alien abductions.

This is for any custom probe mods people wish to add to the Positron.

We have attached the first 'universal' mount system.

The current philosophy of the probe is to give the Positron a Magnetic mount of sorts for various probes.

We've included the STEP files here, and we encourage our community to build upon this, and potentially even design a method of docking probes.

Have fun.
