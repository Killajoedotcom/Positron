# Lip Spool Holder

A simple spool holder that replaces the Z column keystone that requires no setup, but only works with spools that have an inner lip.

It requires a M3 heatset insert and 3 Ã— 6-10mm M3 Flat Head Socket Screws (FHSS) which can likely be sourced from spares includes with thte Positron kit. The bearing is not included, but it is a common 608 bearing commonly found in skateboards or rollerskates.

The mod is printed in two parts, flat and without supports.
