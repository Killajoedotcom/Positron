## The Positron configuration files have moved: [Positron3D/PositronConfig](https://github.com/Positron3D/PositronConfig)

To help make getting the latest configs easier[^1], we've flown the Klipper configuration files over to [Positron3D/PositronConfig](https://github.com/Positron3D/PositronConfig) so you can easily download just the latest configurations without having to download the whole repository or individual files, or copy-paste the contents of the files.

We will also be able to have alternate configuration sets in the future for common mods or experimental tweaks, so stay tuned. In the meantime, happy printing![^2]

[^1]: Except for this time I guess, given you're here...
[^2]: Though not on planes, only shameful printing on planes.[^9000]
[^9000]: I just figured out how to use these footnotes so I'm abusing it
